# Amazon

This is one of my small projects. 

For the first test here, I have done a local image with an image from the website comparison. 

After that, I have done several tests regarding sorting the products and asserting if the sorting was successful or not. 

When it comes to the necessary packages, I have used:

Selenium, 

NUnit, 

Selenium Extras, 

Chrome Driver
